&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Know ye little Alf</i>?</p>
<p>Alf he builds a vessel stout,<br />
For he will rove and sail about.</p>
<p>Alf he builds a vessel high,<br />
The trade of pirate he will try.</p>
<p>He draws on the sand a circle mark,<br />
And with a bound he gained the bark.</p>
<p>Upon the prow Alf foremost stood,<br />
And Copenhagen&rsquo;s koggers view&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

He knew the course the vessels took.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There koggers nine salute mine eyes,<br />
All, all they bear shall be my prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone into a boat he goes,<br />
And briskly to the koggers rows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well met, ye Courtmen, clad in mail<br />
Unto what haven do ye sail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unto that haven we are bound,<br />
Where Alf is likeliest to be found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will ye on the man bestow<br />
Who unto ye Sir Alf can show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silver and gold to him we&rsquo;ll give,<br />
All he can wish for shall he receive.</p>
<p>Presents of worth he shall not miss,<br />
The robber&rsquo;s vessel shall be his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall be the pirates&rsquo; lot,<br />

<p>Till he was weary Alf he hew&rsquo;d,<br />
In fifteen Courtmen&rsquo;s gore he stood.</p>
<p>He captured all the koggers nine,<br />
And sailed for Norway o&rsquo;er the brine.</p>
<p>To Rostock in the tiding goes,<br />
Then palened many a cheek of rose.</p>
<p>Widow and child lamented sore,<br />
This hurtful hawk had made them poor.</p>
<p>But they must thole this damage all,<br />
Their tears but bootless, bootless fall.<br />

8</span>SIR ALF THE FREEBOOTER<br />
<i>Song the Second</i></h2>
<p>Sir Alf will not stay in Norroway land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he passes his time there wearily;<br />
Full fifteen lordships in fief he holds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He can live thereout right merrily.</p>
<p>Sir Alf he walks on the verdant wold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conning his breviary;<br />
There meets him Bendit Rimaardson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For God of his sins was weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morrow, good day, thou little Sir Alf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art a valiant noble,<br />
But if thou become the King&rsquo;s prisoner to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The land will know less trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;I am not the little Sir Alf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I vow by the holy Mary;<br />
I am but a little mass-boy, Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the priest the wine I carry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bendit lifted his high, high hat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And upon his visage staring,<br />
Said: &ldquo;Thou art the little Norwegian Alf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If mine eyes are the truth declaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wast a school boy along with me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou darest not deny it;<br />
And well at the school I remember thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou gavest us no quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou be Bendit Rimaardson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art my near relation;<br />
If to-day thou wilt swear thou knowest me not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou wilt do me an obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But straight they took the little Sir Alf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gyves to his legs they fastened;<br />
And away, away to Helsingborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the captive Alf they hastened.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;Now take little Alf to the chamber high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the hall of the regal tower,<br />
That the Queen at her ease, and her maids, if they please.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May behold this thief of power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then up and spake the Danish Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On first little Alf espying:<br />
&ldquo;The man that I see cannot surely be he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose fame through the world is flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I of stature be little and mean,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve every manly talent,<br />
And ne&rsquo;er wilt thou bear thy lord an heir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half, half so good and gallant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give my mantle with roses red,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lilies flowered over,<br />
If I might sleep one night with thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And play the ardent lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I one night with thee might sleep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; None knowing but thy maid servant,<br />
For then, I ween, thou would&rsquo;st beg, fair Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my pardon in accents fervent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Then answered him the Danish Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As she struck the board with vigour:<br />
&ldquo;To-morrow, ere folk to breakfast go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a gibbet thou shalt figure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why hang&rsquo;st thou not Ivor of Holsterbro,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Canute of Sonderboro?<br />
They were thieves like me, but they slept with thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their death would have caused thee
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they took away the little Sir Alf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the hall of the regal tower;<br />
For the beauteous Queen and her ladies had seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough of this thief of power.</p>
<p>They led the little Count Sir Alf<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out East from Helsing city;<br />
With contrite breast he his sins confess&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to God he cried for pity.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Now I counsel each noble woman&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He in honour&rsquo;s courses guide him,<br />
With his equals dwell in the land, for well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With all will that land provide him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many a day and many a year<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve plundered, as every one knoweth;<br />
But what we win with injustice and sin<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With shame and sorrow goeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Count was I, of Erling&rsquo;s race,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er Timsberg&rsquo;s rich fief I lorded;<br
/>
That filled me with pride, and my will I would have,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though my will with no law accorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, first on all who my hate had won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I murders foul committed;<br />
Then to wife and maid no respect I paid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But shamefully them I treated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the needy citizen his goods<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his life besides I&rsquo;ve riven;<br />
Widow and orphans my deeds bemoan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for vengeance cry to heaven.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;Lord God to me kind and clement be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And grant me this petition:<br />
Let me gain, when this death of shame I&rsquo;ve thol&rsquo;d,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into endless life admission.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>LITTLE DANNEVED AND SWAYNE TROST.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;O what shall I in Denmark do?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear your armour I&rsquo;m too weak;<br />
The Danish warriors jeer at me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because their tongue I cannot speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the young Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He bade them saddle his courser grey:<br />
&ldquo;O I will ride to Borrebye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a visit to my mother pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O clinking were his spurs so keen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And swiftly sped his horse along;<br />
At Lundy Kirk in Skaaney land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped to hear the matin song.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>O first he heard the matin song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear nine masses stopped he then;<br />
And now it lists young Danneved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mount upon his steed again.</p>
<p>Out spake Oluf, the aged and good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was I ween the parish priest:<br />
&ldquo;I beg of thee, little Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be this day my honoured guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day I&rsquo;ll break with no man bread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor drink a drop of rosy wine,<br />
Until I come to Borrebye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hold discourse with mother mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear me, dearest Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give o&rsquo;er, I beg, thy purpose straight;<br />
So many of thy enemies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the town in ambush wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O first I trust in my faulchion good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then I trust in my courser tall,<br />
And next to them in my merry swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But in my own self most of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well to trust in thy faulchion
good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis well to trust in thy courser tall,<br />
But do not trust in thy merry swains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For they&rsquo;ll deceive thee first of
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was little Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Abroad before the town he came;<br />
And there met him his enemies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thrice nine in number were the same.</p>
<p>So numerous were these enemies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For him that did in ambush lie,<br />
All Danneved&rsquo;s swains they took their leave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from their lord did basely fly.</p>
<p>All his merry men took their leave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from their master basely flew,<br />
Except the young Swayne Trost alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He with his lord took on anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O I, my Lord, your clothes have worn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ridden have I, my Lord, your steed,<br />
And I will stand by you to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor leave you in your greatest need.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;O I have taken your silver and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I have eaten of your bread,<br />
And I&rsquo;ll not budge from you to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Although my life-blood I should shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they their backs together placed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Master and man, in the forest green;<br />
And in the early morning tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They of the foemen slew fifteen.</p>
<p>Then they their backs together placed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where thick and high the bushes were;<br />
They twain alone full thirty slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquiring honour ever fair.</p>
<p>It was the young Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his side his trusty faulchion tied;<br />
And now they both so joyously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Home to his mother&rsquo;s castle ride.</p>
<p>It was the young Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came riding to the Castellaye;<br />
It was then his mother dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came out to meet him, blythe and gay.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;Be welcome, little Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be welcome to this house of mine;<br />
What doth it please thee now to drink?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O, say, shall it be mead or wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I will ne&rsquo;er break bread with you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or drink a drop of mead or wine,<br />
&rsquo;Till thou hast given the young Swayne Trost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair Ellen, only sister mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do thou hear, my dearest son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear what I now declare to thee;<br />
As God shall help me in my need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brothers of Ellen both ye be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;st not to me the truth declar&rsquo;d;<br
/>
Where didst thou bear the young Swayne Trost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That of his birth I never heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O he was but a little child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When him from out the land I sent;<br />
And, hearing it said that he was dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To none I did my loss lament.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>Then up spoke little Danneved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He was the son of a knight so high:<br />
&ldquo;Now I have such a brother found,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I never more will grieve or sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing upon thee, young Swayne Trost,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To thee my troth I now will give;<br />
I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er deceive thee, young Swayne Trost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as I on earth shall live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Danneved and young Swayne Trost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sables and mard themselves array;<br />
And both of them took so joyously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the imperial Court their way.</p>

20</span>SIR PALL, SIR BEAR, AND SIR LIDEN.</h2>
<p>Liden he rode to the Ting, and shewed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His bloody gashes there:<br />
&ldquo;And these were done by no other one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But my dear brother Bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With humble air upstood Sir Bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for leave to speak he cried:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee gold and silver to hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my good broad lands beside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep thou thyself thy silver pelf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy good broad lands for me;<br />
By God I swear this little hand fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy death, brother Bear, shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Home to their hall ride Bear and Pall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With unsuspicious mind;<br />
In wrathful mood, with five swains good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Followed Liden close behind.</p>
<p>Sir Pall, and Sir Bear, and Sir Liden, three were,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they met the boughs beneath:<br />
&rsquo;Twas sad to view how quick out-flew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their faulchions from the sheath.</p>
<p>First Pall he slew his brother true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Bear to death he smote;<br />
I tell to ye for verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His own death wound he got.</p>
<p>They took up with care Sir Pall and Sir Bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the city them they bore;<br />
Beneath the skies in the greenwood lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Liden amid his gore.</p>
<p>To the earn and the owl and the beasts that prowl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Liden&rsquo;s corpse they left;<br />
When that was said to his plighted maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She died of sense bereft.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Had he paid heed to his mother&rsquo;s rede,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And himself to the law address&rsquo;d,<br />
His brothers twain had remained unslain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their feud had been laid at rest.</p>
<p>In piteous mode wept Mettelil proud,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The death of her three sons bold:<br />
&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;That e&rsquo;er
my eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should this sad hour behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Pall she wept sore, and still, still more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For Bear the good and brave;<br />
But most of all for Sir Liden&rsquo;s fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For he had no hallowed grave.</p>

From the spot, or nigh it, where<br />
It joins the Tagus broad and fair,<br />

Albarcas made of slain wolf hide,<br />
In blood of cow or heifer dyed.<br />
O snow-white pointed shoes wore he,<br />
Green stockings gartered at the knee;<br />
Button composed of burning glass,<br />
Presented, mind ye, by his lass.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
